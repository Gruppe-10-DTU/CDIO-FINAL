# CDIO-FINAL

To get the program on your pc you can either download it as a zip folder from github.com or clone it to your pc. The main branch will always have the most up to date code.

To run the program, open the project in your favorite IDE and execute the main method in src/main/java/Start.java.

All tests for the program can be found in the src/test/java folder. We have a folder with acceptance tests for each of our user stories that can be run manually, alongside unitstest that be executed automatically.
